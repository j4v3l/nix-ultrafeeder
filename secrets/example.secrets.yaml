# Keep whatever you want in here; only keys you map in Nix (`envToSecret*`) get

# --- External feeder containers (optional) ---
#
# These are typically run as separate containers that read from Ultrafeeder's
# BEAST ports (e.g. 30005). Env var names are from the upstream SDR-E repos:
# - PiAware/FlightAware: FEEDER_ID
# - FlightRadar24: FR24KEY / FR24KEY_UAT
# - PlaneFinder: SHARECODE
# - AirNav Radar: SHARING_KEY

flightradar24_FR24KEY_UAT: "REPLACE_ME" # optional
planefinder_SHARECODE: "REPLACE_ME"
airnavradar_SHARING_KEY: "REPLACE_ME"

# --- Other placeholders (commented) ---
#
# Ultrafeeder itself is usually configured without secrets, but if you do have
# sensitive env vars in your setup, map them here.
